# 👋 Hello, I'm June Hong

🚀 **Software Architect | Technical Leader | Innovator**

With over **10 years of software development** and **12 years of management experience**, I've led high-impact teams across global tech giants like **Samsung**, **NTT**, and **NEC**. My work spans **cloud platforms**, **smart mobile devices**, and **embedded systems**, delivering solutions that power millions of users.

I specialize in **applying machine learning to solve real-world problems with precision and scalability**. My expertise spans TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, enabling me to deliver robust solutions in image classification, object detection, NLP, predictive analytics, and time-series forecasting. What truly excites me is **bridging the gap between intelligent models and practical deployment**, integrating ML-powered features seamlessly into mobile apps, cloud platforms, and embedded systems.

My technical toolkit includes C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, ARM Assembler, Embedded Linux, FreeRTOS, and a wide array of communication and networking protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, MQTT, VoIP SIP, Modbus). I'm also proficient with modern web and cloud technologies like SpringBoot, React-Redux, Azure, AWS, Docker, and various databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB).

As a bilingual professional (English and Korean), I thrive in dynamic, cross-cultural environments, driving innovation and delivering solutions that power millions of users globally. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create tangible impact and am always eager to connect with fellow innovators and leaders.
