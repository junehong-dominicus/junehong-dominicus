### 🚀 Professional Summary

With over **22 years of engineering experience**—combining a decade of core development with 12+ years of technical management—I architect and deliver mission-critical systems for global tech giants like **Samsung**, **NTT**, and **NEC**.

My core competency lies in the convergence of **Cloud Native Architectures**, **Embedded Firmware**, and **Edge AI**. I specialize in **productionizing Machine Learning models**, moving beyond experimentation to deploy robust, scalable inference engines. My expertise encompasses the full ML lifecycle—from data engineering and model training with **TensorFlow/Keras** to optimization for resource-constrained environments (Embedded Linux/RTOS).

### 🎯 Technical Focus
*   **Systems Engineering:** Deep experience in **Embedded Linux**, **FreeRTOS**, and **Bare Metal** development on ARM architectures.
*   **Full-Stack & Cloud:** Architecting microservices with **Spring Boot** and **Django**, deployed via **Docker** on **AWS/Azure**.
*   **Connectivity:** Implementing complex protocol stacks (**TCP/IP, MQTT, SIP/RTP, Modbus, BACnet**) for high-reliability IoT, Industrial Automation, and VoIP communications.
