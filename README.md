## 🌟 Architectural Philosophy

- **LLMs as Cognitive Layers:** Language models should reason, explain, and assist—not replace physics or control logic.
- **State Over Data:** Digital Twins must model behavior and evolution, not just metrics.
- **Production First:** Observability, tracing, and evaluation are mandatory for real-world AI systems.
- **Human-Centric AI:** Systems should communicate clearly with operators and engineers.
